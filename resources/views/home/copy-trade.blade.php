                    It's all in the name! Copy trading allows you to directly copy the positions taken by another
                    trader. You decide the amount you wish to invest and simply copy everything they do automatically in
                    real-time – when that trader makes a trade, your account will make that same trade as well. You do
                    not need to have any input on the trades, and you get the identical returns on each trade as your
                    chosen trader. But by copying another trader, you could potentially make money based on their
                    skills. In fact, no advanced knowledge of the financial market is required to take part!

                    Copy Trading is both a product and a service. We cater to both the traders and investors looking to
                    capitalize in the cryptocurrency trading. Being able to copy trades from several expert traders and
                    also allow investors to follow one's trades is a great service in and of itself.

                    We have been trading markets for many years and recently started trading crypto currencies with much
                    success. We originally wanted to put together a portfolio of coins and manage everyone's funds in
                    one account but we soon realized that account segregation and being in control of your funds is the
                    only way to go, especially if we wanted to bring in outside investors. So, after looking around and
                    finding out that there was no way for anyone to copy someone else's trades (unlike any other
                    market), we decided to start working on this project.

                    <p>
                        The history of copy trading goes back to 2005 when traders used to copy specific algorithms that
                        were developed through automated trading. Brokers recognised the potential of having systems
                        where any linked to that trader could automatically copy their trading account. There was no
                        need to constantly monitor email signals or trading 'chat' rooms. Out of this were born services
                        that allowed traders to connect their personal trading accounts to their platform. Traders no
                        longer had to submit their specific strategies. The popularity of copy trading has since
                        exploded.

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-black dark:text-white mb-2">How It Works:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Here is how the copier works: You, as an investor, simply select an expert or experts that you
                        want to copy trades from. Once you are signed up, this is the only action needed on your part.
                        Once you've taken care of the above, you are all set. There are no codes that you need to run or
                        signals for you to manually input. Our software will handle the trade copying automatically on
                        your behalf. We monitor your experts trading activity and as soon as there is a trade, we
                        calculate all the necessary parameters and execute the trade.

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-black dark:text-white mb-2">How Much Do You Need?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The only thing you have to make sure of is that you have enough available base currency that
                        your expert trades with, in your trading account. First, you must meet the exchanges minimum
                        order amount (let's say about $10 per trade to be safe). That means that if your expert executes
                        a 5% order, you must have at least $300 in your account total value (at 100% expert allocation
                        as an example). This also means that you need to have at least 10% or higher in available base
                        currency to avoid missed trades.

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-black dark:text-white mb-2">Who Are the Experts?</h3>
                    <p>
                        We carefully select expert applicants. We get to know them as a trader and examine their trading
                        performance over a period of time. We also tend to look for experts who already have a following
                        to further confirm their competence (social proof). You can also read about every expert on
                        their individual performance pages.

                    When the expert exits a position, you too will exit it. Automatically. You can also change
                    allocation at any time.
